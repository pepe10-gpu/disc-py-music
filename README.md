# disc-py-music
simple discord.py bot that plays music
Are you *sad* that rhythm is dead?
Do you want a simple, open sourced alternative?
yeah this is it.
thank you discord.py devs for making discord.py, and the examples

all videos and music files are saved in the folder "`bot.py`" is in

**(IF you are going to use this, due to legal issues you cant ask for prmium or even donations, google is cruel)**

libs: youtube_dl discord (use this `pip install -U "discord.py[voice]"`)
